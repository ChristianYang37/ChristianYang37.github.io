Hi, I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at Sun Yat-sen University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests include but are not limited to attention computation theory, large language models, AI security, and learning theory.

I am actively seeking a 25 Fall Ph.D. student position in the USA. Please email me if you are interested in me.
